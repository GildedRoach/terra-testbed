      VeraCrypt main features:

          - Creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real disk.
          - Encrypts an entire partition or storage device such as USB flash drive or hard drive.
          - Encrypts a partition or drive where Windows is installed (pre-boot authentication).
          - Encryption is automatic, real-time(on-the-fly) and transparent.
          - Parallelization and pipelining allow data to be read and written as fast as if the drive was not encrypted.
          - Encryption can be hardware-accelerated on modern processors.
          - Provides plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to reveal the password: Hidden volume (steganography) and hidden operating system.
          - More information about the features of VeraCrypt may be found in the documentation
