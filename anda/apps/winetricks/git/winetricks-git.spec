%description
Winetricks is an easy way to work around common problems in Wine.

It has a menu of supported games/apps for which it can do all the
workarounds automatically. It also lets you install missing DLLs
or tweak various Wine settings individually.

This version of Winetricks is built from the latest Git.

It is also compatible with Terra WINE builds.
